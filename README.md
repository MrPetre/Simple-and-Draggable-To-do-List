# Simple-and-Draggable-To-do-List

The item list can be dragged around by hovering and clicking on the header, otherwise go ahead and create a list! Rest is self explanatory.

A very simple To-do list project I created a while back.  Had to create custom code to drag the container the way I wanted it to be.  I could have used draggable and Jquery however there were severe bugs when trying to drag the to-do list as well as a list item.  Otherwise, all possible bugs for this project have been fixed and I didn't want to add any screen boundaries either so yeah it's pretty basic but a neat way of learning Jquery.
